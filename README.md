# 🧠 All-in-One Productivity Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description

This is a personal productivity web application designed to help users, particularly students, combat distractions and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The dashboard integrates three key tools: a to-do list, a multi-page note-taking system, and a custom timer. By centralizing these functions, the application provides a focused, distraction-free environment to improve workflow.
